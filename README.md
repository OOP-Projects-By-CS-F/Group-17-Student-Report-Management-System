# Group-17-Student-Report-Management-System

(#) In this Project we had created an student report card system with the help of CPP (c++) Programming language it will take information about student like name,       roll number, all subject marks etc and stored it inside an file and we can see whole class result or can find perticular student result within the program, and     user cant read file data inside txt file cauz it will be in zibrish (un-understandable) language.
